# search-list
A basic search in a list of different cat breeds using react, JSX, ES6 and Flow syntax support. 

Created with *create-react-app*. See the [full create-react-app guide](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

In order to start the client, run:

```bash
npm install && ng serve (or npm start)
```

**The application uses the [*EmojiOne*](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/emojione) package from [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/about) *Open Source CDN for npm and GitHub*, for a complete set of emojis designed for the web. 
It includes libraries to easily convert unicode characters to shortnames (:smile:) and shortnames to custom emoji images. **
